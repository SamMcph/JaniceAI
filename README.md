JaniceAi is an extremely basic form of Ai. The JaniceAi uses a small SQL Database that holds all of the Training Data and possible responses. The Ai uses a function to be able to determine how frequently a response should be chosen. The Ai also has skills that can help find the weather, time, the date, and print the first four sentences of any Wikipedia page. Janice launches in a python interface in either Training Mode or Development Mode. Training Mode is used to fluctuate the frequency of how often a response is used. While Development Mode removes this feature and creates a more streamlined experience.
