JaniceAi is an extreamly basic form of Ai. Janice is used a small SQL Database that holds all of the Training Data and possible responses. 
The Ai uses a function to be able to determine how frequently a response should be chosen. The Ai also has skills that can help find weather, time, date, and printing the
first four sentances of any wikipeida page. Janice launches in a python interface in either Training Mode or Devlopment Mode. Training Mode is used to fluctuate the
frequency of how often a response is used. While Devlopment Mode removes this feature and creates a more streamlined experience.
